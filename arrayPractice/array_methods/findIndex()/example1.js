// This JavaScript code snippet uses the findIndex method on an array to find the index of the first element that satisfies a specific condition. Let's break down the code:

var arr = [5, 22, 19, 25, 34];
var result = arr.findIndex((x) => x > 20);
document.write(result);

// Here's the explanation for each part of the code:

//1. var arr = [5, 22, 19, 25, 34];:

// -Creates an array named arr with five numeric elements.
//2. var result = arr.findIndex(x => x > 20);:

// -Uses the findIndex method on the array to find the index of the first element (x) that is greater than 20.
// -The x => x > 20 is an arrow function acting as a callback that defines the condition for finding the index.
// -If no element satisfies the condition, the findIndex method returns -1.
// 3. document.write(result);:

//- Outputs the result to the document. In this case, it will print the index of the first element in the array that is greater than 20.

// In your specific example, the output will be 1 because 22 is the first element in the array that is greater than 20, and its index is 1 (array indices start from 0). If no element in the array satisfies the condition, it would output -1.
