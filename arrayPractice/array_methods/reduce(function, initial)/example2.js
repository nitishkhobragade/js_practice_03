////Here's an example to display the difference of the array elements using reduce() method.

// var a=[30,15, 4 ,2];
// document.write("The difference of the array elements is: ");
// document.write(a.reduce(reducer_func));
// function reducer_func(net,n){
// return net-n;
// }

////Certainly! Let's break down the provided JavaScript code step by step:

var a = [30, 15, 4, 2];

////This line initializes an array a with four elements: 30, 15, 4, and 2.

document.write("The difference of the array elements is: ");

////This line writes a string to the document, indicating that the following value will be the difference of the array elements.

document.write(a.reduce(reducer_func));

////The reduce method is being used here to calculate the difference of all elements in the array. The reduce method takes a callback function (reducer_func) as an argument.

function reducer_func(net, n) {
  return net - n;
}

// The reducer_func is the callback function passed to the reduce method. It has two parameters:

//- net: Accumulator, which is the result of the previous iterations.
//- n: The current element being processed in the array.
// Inside the reducer_func, the accumulator (net) is updated by subtracting the current element (n) in each iteration.

// The reduce method essentially performs the following operations:

// Iteration 1: net = 30 - 15 (current element is 15)
// Iteration 2: net = 15 - 4 (current element is 4)
// Iteration 3: net = 11 - 2 (current element is 2)
// Finally, the result (net) is the difference of all elements in the array.

document.write("The difference of the array elements is: ");
document.write(a.reduce(reducer_func));

////These lines output the string "The difference of the array elements is: " to the document, followed by the result of the reduce operation, which is the difference of the elements in the array [30, 15, 4, 2]. The output will be "The difference of the array elements is: 9".
