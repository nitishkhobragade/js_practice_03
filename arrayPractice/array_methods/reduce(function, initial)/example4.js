////Certainly! Let's break down the provided JavaScript code step by step:
var net = [3];

////This line initializes an array net with a single element: 3.

var calc = net.reduce(
    (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue
);

// The reduce method is being used here to calculate the sum of all elements in the array. The reduce method takes an arrow function as an argument.

// The arrow function has two parameters:

// accumulator: Accumulator, which is the result of the previous iterations.
// currentValue: The current element being processed in the array.
// In this case, there's no need to provide an initial value for the accumulator, as the array has only one element. The reduce method will use that single element as the initial value.

// The reduce method essentially performs the following operation:

// Iteration 1: accumulator = 3 (current element is 3)
// Since there is only one element in the array, the arrow function is applied only once, and the result is the single element itself.

// Finally, the result (accumulator) is stored in the variable calc.

document.write("The total of the array element comes out to be: " + calc);

////This line writes a string to the document, followed by the result of the reduce operation, which is the sum of the elements in the array [3]. The output will be "The total of the array element comes out to be: 3".
