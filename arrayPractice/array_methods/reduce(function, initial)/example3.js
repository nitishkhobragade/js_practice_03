////Here's an example to total the array elements using the arrow function.
// var net=[3,2,5,1,7];  
// var calc=net.reduce(  
// (accumulator,currentValue)=>accumulator+currentValue,0);  
// document.write("The total of the array elements comes out to be: "+calc);
////Certainly! Let's break down the provided JavaScript code step by step:

var net = [3, 2, 5, 1, 7];

///This line initializes an array net with five elements: 3, 2, 5, 1, and 7.

var calc = net.reduce(
    (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0
);

// The reduce method is being used here to calculate the sum of all elements in the array. The reduce method takes an arrow function as an argument.

//// The arrow function has two parameters:

//// accumulator: Accumulator, which is the result of the previous iterations.
//// currentValue: The current element being processed in the array.
//// In each iteration, the arrow function updates the accumulator by adding the current element. The initial value of the accumulator is set to 0 (provided as the second argument to reduce).

//// The reduce method essentially performs the following operations:

//// Iteration 1: accumulator = 0 + 3 (current element is 3)
//// Iteration 2: accumulator = 3 + 2 (current element is 2)
//// Iteration 3: accumulator = 5 + 5 (current element is 5)
//// Iteration 4: accumulator = 10 + 1 (current element is 1)
//// Iteration 5: accumulator = 11 + 7 (current element is 7)
//// Finally, the result (accumulator) is stored in the variable calc.

document.write("The total of the array elements comes out to be: " + calc);

//// This line writes a string to the document, followed by the result of the reduce operation, which is the sum of the elements in the array [3, 2, 5, 1, 7]. The output will be "The total of the array elements comes out to be: 18".
