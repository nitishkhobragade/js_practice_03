//// Here's the simple implementation of keys() method in array.

let arr=['Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri'];   
let itr=arr.keys();  
document.write(itr+"<br>");  
//Looping through each key.  
for (let key of itr) {  
  document.write(key+"<br>");  
}  

////So, according to the number of elements present in the array, a key is assigned to each one.
