// Here's a simple example to create an array from a string.

var arr = Array.from("You are viewing an example of string"); //The string will get converted to an array.
document.write("The resultant is: <br>" + arr);

console.log(typeof arr, "type");

////In the output displayed, it is clear that each letter of the string gets converted to an array element.
