////Here's an example that shows the basic implementation of toLocaleString() method.

var arr = ["ram", "shyam", "Heera"]; // an array is defined.
var str = arr.toLocaleString(); //using array toLocaleString() method
document.write("The array is represented in the string form as:  " + str); // This will  return the array elements in the form of string.

////In the output, the array is represented in the form of string.
