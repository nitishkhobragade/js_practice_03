// Define an array named 'arr' with some numerical elements
var arr = [5, 22, 19, 25, 34];

// Use the 'find' method on the array to find the first element that satisfies the given condition
var result = arr.find((x) => x > 20);

// Display the result using 'document.write'
document.write(result);

Here's what each part of the code does:

// 1. var arr = [5, 22, 19, 25, 34];: Creates an array named arr with five numeric elements.

// 2. var result = arr.find(x => x > 20);: Uses the find method on the array to search for the first element (x) that is greater than 20. The x => x > 20 is an arrow function acting as a callback that defines the condition for finding an element.

// 3. document.write(result);: Outputs the result to the document. In this case, it will print the first element in the array that is greater than 20. If there is no such element, it will print undefined.

// In your specific example, the output will be 22 because it is the first element in the array that is greater than 20.
