Summary
With these array methods, you don't need to use a for loop to search an array. Depending on what you need, you can decide which of the methods is best suited for your use case.

Here is a summary of when to use each method:

Use filter if you want to find all items in an array that meet a specific condition.
Use find if you want to check if that at least one item meets a specific condition.
Use includes if you want to check if an array contains a particular value.
Use indexOf if you want to find the index of a particular item in an array.
