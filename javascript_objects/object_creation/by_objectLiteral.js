//// 1) JavaScript Object by object literal
//// The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:

//// object={property1:value1,property2:value2.....propertyN:valueN}
//// As you can see, property and value is separated by : (colon).

//// Letâ€™s see the simple example of creating object in JavaScript.

emp = { id: 102, name: "Shyam Kumar", salary: 40000 };

document.write(emp.id + " " + emp.name + " " + emp.salary);
