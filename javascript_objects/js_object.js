///// JavaScript Objects
//// A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.

//// JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.

//// JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't create class to get the object. But, we direct create objects.

//// Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScriptâ€™s primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol) in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

// Syntax:
// new Object(value)
// Object(value)
// let object_name = {
//     key_name : value,
//     ...
// }
